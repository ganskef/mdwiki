# MDwiki (v0.6.x forked)

CMS/Wiki using Markdown - 100% client side single-page application - done purely JavaScript and HTML5. No special software installation or server side processing is required. Just upload the `mdwiki.html` into the same directory as your Markdown files and you are good to go!

This is a fork of the stable [Dynalon MDwiki](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki#mdwiki) release [branch v0.6.x](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki/tree/0.6.x) containing updated dependencies with all the beloved features (like Markdown include which is missed in the master branch). The original repository is unmaintained and archived (read-only).

See **<https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/>** for historic info and documentation.
