# MDwiki - Wiki (forked 0.6.x)

This is the markdown source of the MDwiki instance at <https://ganskef.github.io/mdwiki/>.

It is basically the `gh-pages` branch of a MDwiki fork located at <https://github.com/ganskef/mdwiki/>. This fork aims to support future use of MDwiki with **up to date** dependency versions.

The original MDwiki instance at <https://info.mdwiki.org> is based on the archived GitHub repository <https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki/>.

Note on forking

Please don't fork this repo to start your own wiki - you will clutter the list of forks of MDwiki's actual source code and hinder development. But feel free to star this project if you like it :)
